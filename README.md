## ðŸ˜ƒ About Me

# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Salome Gabriel

I'm a **Data Analyst** with over **two years** of hands-on experience turning raw data into actionable insights.

As the demand for robust data infrastructure continues to grow, Iâ€™ve chosen to **pivot into Data Engineering** to deepen my understanding of how data is sourced, structured, and transformed before it reaches analysts like me.

I'm also an enthusiastic explorer of **Artificial Intelligence**, currently experimenting with creative coding projects like **vibecoding** on [Replit](https://replit.com) â€” blending tech with imagination to push boundaries and learn by doing.


> **_Disclaimer:_**  
> This is my first attempt at building something like this, and I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to _DataWithBaraa_ for thoroughly documenting the process and sharing the resources that made this possible.  
> I genuinely believe this marks the beginning of my journey toward creating more scalable data warehouses and robust data infrastructures.
